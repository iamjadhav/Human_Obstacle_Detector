\subsection*{Overview}

Obstacle detection has been widely studied in the field of Computer Vision. It is a crucial part of Self Driving Cars as well as Industrial Autonomous Systems. In the case of Self Driving Cars, a sub-\/task of Obstacle Detection can be Detection of Humans who become obvious and high risk obstacles for the vehicles. The real-\/time Human Obstacle Detection becomes increasingly difficult in noisy and chaotic environments and hence the algorithms deployed need to be highly efficient and robust to flimsy environmental variables. For example, color based approaches lack efficiency in unstable lighting environments. Deep Learning based approaches offer high efficiency but are extremely expensive to implement.

This project attempts to implement a Perception module for A\+C\+ME Robotics using high-\/quality software engineering practices such as the Agile Iterative Process, Object Oriented Programming, Pair Programming and Test Driven Development. We attempt to achieve robust human detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (H\+OG) feature descriptor combined with a Support Vector Machine Model. The algorithm uses H\+OG features extracted from the input data to detect Humans and surround them with rectangular bounding boxes, the centers of which act as the pixel coordinates of the detected humans. These coordinates combined with the pose matrix of the homogeneous transformation between the monocular camera and the 3D world will be used to track the detected humans. The pixel coordinates will be used for determining the distance of the humans with respect to the Robotâ€™s Reference Frame. Support Vector Machine classifier will be used to train the extracted H\+OG features to train the training data.

The results of the Phase-\/1 are avilable in the Demo section. The technologies(libraries, tools, systems) used in order to build this project are listed in the next section.

\subsection*{Technology Used}

We will be following the Agile Iterative Software Development Process and the Test Driven Development Process. We will plan the work in Sprints and switch between the roles of driver and navigator throughout the process.
